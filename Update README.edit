## Android Device Names Registry

This repo hosts the combined efforts of Jared Rummler's [AndroidDeviceNames](https://github.com/jaredrummler/AndroidDeviceNames) JSON db and modifications made by members of the [XDA Developers](https://www.xda-developers.com) community.

The goal is to create a list that accurately identifies devices by the official name given by each respective vendor.

This repo is used with Tadej Slamic's [AndroidDeviceNames v2](https://github.com/tslamic/AndroidDeviceNames) library as a source for device name lookup.
